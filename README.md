# string2
## What's its purpose ?
It's just a small code snippet using the most-possible vanilla C to ship code anywhere and import the less headers files possible.
It's used to interact with character arrays, or "C strings".
Maybe in the future I'll provide a custom data structure like a linked list of characters to make these dynamic.
## Is that all ?
Not at all, the headers are susceptible of changing with time.
When I'll got some suggestions or more ideas of useful things to add to this project, I'll do it for sure, as I'll use it in my other projects too.
## Context of creating this ?
I had a school C project with a colleague, and as we have to use the less possible of STD to get a good grade and he's still learning the C language, I've decided to code this and maybe publish it.
It can be useful for some people and contribute to my portfolio I guess, so waiting for incoming much bigger projects, I'll put this here.
## Why is there a "main.c" file in the project ?
To show you how to use the provided functions, in case the comments aren't clear enough (tell me !) 
## How can I use it ?
Just download the source code, put it in your working project folder, and include it just like you would include any other header file.
Think of putting my name somewhere in your code, please ðŸ˜€
